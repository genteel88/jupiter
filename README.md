# jupiter - Job recommendation project

This app is to help the job seeker to find the new opportunity based on his/her saved favourite job history record, and recommend some new positions that fit for job seeker's interests. 

We use the third party API to extract keywords from description of positions, and design algorithm (content-based recommendation) to implement job recommendation, and deploy to Amazon EC2.

The main application stacks used are standard frontend tools - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and backend tools - REST, MySQL/AWS RDS, Java Servlet.
